Interactive Quiz Application â€“ Internship Project at CodTech IT Solution

As part of my internship at CodTech IT Solution, under the mentorship of Neela Santosh, I developed a fully functional Interactive Quiz Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This web-based project was created to deliver a dynamic and engaging quiz experience for users, using both a JSON file and an external API that provides random questions and answers.

Project Highlights: Simple and Responsive UI: Built with HTML and styled using CSS, the interface is clean, user-friendly, and responsive across devices. Interactive elements and smooth transitions enhance the user experience.

Dynamic Question System: The quiz fetches questions from an external API, providing randomized and real-time content. In the absence of API data, a local JSON file serves as a fallback, ensuring uninterrupted functionality.

Real-Time Feedback and Scoring: Users receive instant feedback after each question. Correct answers update the score, and visual cues indicate right or wrong selections.

Timer Functionality: Each question has a countdown timer to increase engagement and challenge the user.

High Score Feature: A dedicated Highscore Page allows users to view and compare scores. Scores are stored using localStorage, so users can track their progress over time.

Modular and Maintainable Code: JavaScript is written in a modular format, with clear separation between data handling, UI updates, and game logic. This makes the code easy to read and scale.

Learning Outcomes: Gained hands-on experience with DOM manipulation, asynchronous JavaScript, and the fetch API.

Learned to handle data dynamically from APIs and structure fallback mechanisms using JSON.

Improved understanding of local storage, time-based events, and interactive web design.

Practiced creating responsive layouts with pure CSS and efficient event handling in JS.

Conclusion: This project helped me build strong foundational skills in frontend development and problem-solving. It provided practical experience in developing a real-world application from scratch and strengthened my confidence in working with core web technologies. The guidance from my mentor, Neela Santosh, played a key role in refining my approach to UI/UX and coding standards.# Quiz-Application
